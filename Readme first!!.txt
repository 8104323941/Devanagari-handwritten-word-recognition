
1) Run main.py to get started with the recognition task ,the code will ask for image directory, just enter the 

path to image wherever you have set your directory and continue clicking space/enter whenever a new window pops up showing bounding box,etc 

at the end the final result would be printed . 

2) The code requires certain libraries to perform the image preprocessing and model building thus running the code through an environment made in
anaconda is highly recommended, however if one has the libraries preinstalled in his/her python ide than there should'nt be any probelm.

3) Whole code could also be run on a jupyter notebook .

4) Refer "Model training explained.py" to understant how the model was trained.
